# Decentralized Exchange using Ethereum Smart Contract

Ethereum Smart Contract for decentralized exchange to swap one token with other without any middleman and in trustworthy way. In short P2P money swap machine.

## Features

- Exchange TokenA with TokenB without middleman
- Liquidity pools
- ERC20 standard to create tokens
- Constant Product formula to decide exchange rate
- Completely Decentralized
- Swap fees for each swap transaction
- Incentive for liquidity providers
- Sanity checks to ensure safe arithmetic
- Swapping mechanism
- Tracking metrics to keep track of tokenA and tokenB
- Simulation script to simulate the usage of DEX smart contract
## Tech Stack

**Solidity**: The core language used to create the project.

**Javascript**: The language used to create simulation script of the smart contract.

**Remix IDE**: The online IDE to create smart contract.

**ERC 20 Standard**: To create tokens.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/menishantsharma/DEX-SmartContract
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd DEX-SmartContract
```

Deploy the contracts using Remix or your preferred Ethereum development environment.

Use the `simulate_DEX.js` simulation script to test the functionality of the contracts.
